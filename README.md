Many things can make one's heart smile with joy. [HappyDB](https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/) is "a corpus of 100,000 crowd-sourced happy moments". Participants were given a simple *task*:

```
What made you happy today? 

Reflect on the past 24 hours, 
and recall three actual events 
that happened to you that made you happy. 
Write down your happy moment 
in a complete sentence.
(Write three such moments.)
```
The goal of this project is to look deeper into the causes that make us happy. Natural language processing and text mining are natural tools to derive interesting findings in this collection of happy moments. 

### Challenge 

In this project you will carry out an exploratory data analysis of the corpus of [HappyDB](https://rit-public.github.io/HappyDB/) and write a blog on interesting findings.

You are tasked to explore the texts using tools from text mining and natural language processing such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc, all available in `R` and write a blog post using `R` Notebook. Your blog should be in the form of a `data story` blog on interesting trends and patterns identified by your analysis of these happy moments. 

Data from the HappyDB project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/rit-public/HappyDB/tree/master/happydb/data). Before carrying out any analysis, you should read the [description of the data files](https://github.com/rit-public/HappyDB).
